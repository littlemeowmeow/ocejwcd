  "question": "Your web application requires the adding and deleting of many session attributes during a complex use case. A bug report has come in that indicates that an important session attribute is being deleted too soon and a NullPointerException is being thrown several interactions after the fact. You have decided to create a session event listener that will log when attributes are being deleted so you can track down when the attribute is erroneously being deleted.\nWhich listener class will accomplish this debugging goal?",
  "options": {
    "A": "Create an HttpSessionAttributeListener class and implement the attributeDeleted method and log the attribute name using the getName method on the event object.",
    "C": "Create an SessionAttributeListener class and implement the attributeRemoved method and log the attribute name using the getAttributeName method on the event object.",
    "B": "Create an HttpSessionAttributeListener class and implement the attributeRemoved method and log the attribute name using the getName method on the event object.",
    "D": "Create an SessionAttributeListener class and implement the attributeDeleted method and log the attribute name using the getAttributeName method on the event object."
