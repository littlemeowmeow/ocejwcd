  "answer": "A",
  "explanation": "When HTTPOnly flag is assigned to a cookie, the browser will restrict the access to such Cookie from Java Script code hence the cookie would only be sent to the subsequent request to server but cannot be accessed using client side script. In such a case even if website is vulnerable to Cross Site Scripting (XSS) attacks, still the browser would safeguard the data stored into cookies flagged as HTTPOnly.\n\nIncorrect:\nNot cookie.setSecure(true): If Secure flag is set for Cookie then it may only be transmitted over secure channel(SSL/HTTPS) ensuring that data is always encrypted while transmitting from client to server.",
