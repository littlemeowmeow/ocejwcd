    "question": "You have built a web application with tight security. Several directories of your webapp are used<br>for internal purposes and you have overridden the default servlet to send an HTTP 403 status<br>code for any request that maps to one of these directories. During testing, the Quality Assurance\ndirector decided that they did NOT like seeing the bare response page generated by Firefox and\nInternet Explorer. The director recommended that the webapp should return a more user-friendly\nweb page that has the same look-and-feel as the webapp plus links to the webapp\u2019s search\nengine. You have created this JSP page in the /WEB-INF/jsps/error403.jsp file. You do NOT want\nto alter the complex logic of the default servlet. How can you declare that the web container must\nsend this JSP page whenever a 403 status is generated?",
