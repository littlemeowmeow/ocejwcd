    "question": "To take advantage of the capabilities of modern browsers that use web standards, such as<br>XHTML and CSS, your web application is being converted from simple JSP pages to JSP<br>Document format. However, one of your JSPs, /scripts/screenFunctions.jsp, generates a\nJavaScript file. This file is included in several web forms to create screen-specific validation\nfunctions and are included in these pages with the following statement:\n10. <head>\n11. <script src=\u2019/scripts/screenFunctions.jsp\u2019\n12. language=\u2019javascript\u2019\n13. type=\u2019application/javascript\u2019> </script>\n14. </head>\n15. <!\u2013 body of the web form \u2013>\nWhich JSP code snippet declares that this JSP Document is a JavaScript file?",

        "A": "<%@ page contentType=\u2019application/javascript\u2019 %>",

        "D": "<jsp:directive.page contentType=\u2019application/javascript\u2019 />",
        "E": "No declaration is needed because the web form XHTML page already declares the MIME type of the /scripts/screenFunctions.jsp file in the <script> tag."
