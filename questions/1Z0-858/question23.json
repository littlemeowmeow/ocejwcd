    "question": "Your web application requires the adding and deleting of many session attributes during a<br>complex use case. A bug report has come in that indicates that an important session attribute is<br>being deleted too soon and a NullPointerException is being thrown several interactions after the\nfact. You have decided to create a session event listener that will log when attributes are being\ndeleted so you can track down when the attribute is erroneously being deleted.\nWhich listener class will accomplish this debugging goal?",
    "options": {
        "A": "Create an HttpSessionAttributeListener class and implement the attributeDeleted method and log the attribute name using the getName method on the event object.",
        "B": "Create an HttpSessionAttributeListener class and implement the attributeRemoved method and log the attribute name using the getName method on the event object.",
        "C": "Create an SessionAttributeListener class and implement the attributeRemoved method and log the attribute name using the getAttributeName method on the event object.",
        "D": "Create an SessionAttributeListener class and implement the attributeDeleted method and log the attribute name using the getAttributeName method on the event object."
