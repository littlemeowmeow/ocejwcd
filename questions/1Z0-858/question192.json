    "question": "You are designing an n-tier Java EE application. You have already decided that some of your<br>JSPs will need to get data from a Customer entity bean. You are trying to decide whether to use a<br>Customer stub object or a Transfer Object. Which two statements are true? (Choose two.)",

        "E": "Only the Transfer Object will need to use a Business Delegate.",
        "F": "Using the stub approach allows you to design the application without using a Service Locator."
