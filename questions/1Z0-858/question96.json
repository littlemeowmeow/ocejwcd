    "question": "A web application contains a tag file called beta.tag in /WEB-INF/tags/alpha. A JSP page called<br>sort.jsp exists in the web application and contains only this JSP code:<br>1. <%@ taglib prefix=\u201dx\u201d\n2. tagdir=\u201d/WEB-INF/tags/alpha\u201d %>\n3. <x:beta />\nThe sort.jsp page is requested.\nWhich two are true? (Choose two.)",
    "options": {
        "A": "Tag files can only be accessed using a tagdir attribute.",
        "B": "The sort.jsp page translates successfully and invokes the tag defined by beta.tag.",
        "C": "The sort.jsp page produces a translation error because a taglib directive must always have a uri attribute.",
        "D": "Tag files can only be placed in /WEB-INF/tags, and NOT in any subdirectories of /WEBINF/tags.",
        "E": "The tagdir attribute in line 2 can be replaced by a uri attribute if a TLD referring to beta.tag is created and added to the web application.",
        "F": "The sort.jsp page produces a translation error because the tagdir attribute on lines 1-2 specifies a directory other than /WEB-INF/tags, which is illegal."
