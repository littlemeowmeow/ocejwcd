    "question": "Your company has a corporate policy that prohibits storing a customer\u2019s credit card number in any<br>corporate database. However, users have complained that they do NOT want to re-enter their<br>credit card number for each transaction.

Furthermore, they also want to protect this\ninformation during transit from the web browser to the web container; so the cookie must only be\ntransmitted over HTTPS.
